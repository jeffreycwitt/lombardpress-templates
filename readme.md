#LombardPress Templates

LombardPress Templates are starter XML documents tailored to the Lombardpress TEI customization schema. 

If you're going to begin a diplomatic transcription of medieval Sentences Commentary, copy the `template-diplomatic.xml` file and then begin transcribing following the conventions specified in the LombardPress schema and illustrated in the sample document. 

If you're going to begin a critical transcription, copy the `template-critical.xml` and then begin creating the edition.
